# Simple and light docker-compose stack for PHP apps

Stack with three cointainres: Nginx, PHP-fpm and Postgres with the purpose to use with any PHP project.

You can use (almost) the same enviroment to develop, production and testing!

This is a perfect alternative to usual Vagrant images... Forget Virtualbox and VMWare for develop!

Each container is based in Alpine linux, a light distro which has only 5 Mb. This is a very light stack and scalable (this depends of your app)

## Requirements

You only need docker and docker-compose installed.

Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Run

```
docker-compose up
```

Now, you only have to visit http://localhost:8888 In http://localhost:8888/example.php you can see a little example querying Postgres
